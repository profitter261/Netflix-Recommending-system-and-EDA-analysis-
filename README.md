# Netflix-Recommending-system-and-EDA-analysis-

Developed an end-to-end Netflix Data Analysis and Machine Learning Recommendation System. Cleaned and analyzed the Netflix dataset using Python (Pandas, Seaborn), identifying top genres, content trends, and rating distributions. Built a movie recommendation model using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. Deployed the model using Flask with a simple web interface for real-time recommendations.
